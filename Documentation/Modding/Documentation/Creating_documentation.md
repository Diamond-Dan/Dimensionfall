### Help creation
This page includes information about creating documentation files

The format of documentation files should be .md. The contents of the file should contain **Github Flavored Markdown** formatted text. Since the documentation will also be viewable in-game, only the formatting supported by [this addon](https://github.com/daenvil/MarkdownLabel) will work.

Put new documentation files inside one of the folders in the `Documentation` folder. If needed, create a new subfolder. The documentation files either be edited locally, or in your browser using the editor on Github. When editing in Github, keep the formatting limitations described above in mind.

### File names
File names should start with a capital letter. Instead of a space " ", use an unders core _. Keep in mind that in the in-game menu, the file name will be the display name in the documentation list and underscores will be replaced with a space.
